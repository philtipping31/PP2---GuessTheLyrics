### Validator Testing

- HTML
  - Checked all pages through the official [W3C validator] - I had issues with trailing slashes which CodeAnywhere seemed to add when saving and auto formatting. This was the same for my PP1.

- CSS
  - No errors were found when passing through the official [W3C CSS Validation Service]
- JavaScript
  - 
- Lighthouse
  - I ran my project through lighthouse to ensure the accessibility level was to a high standard on all pages.
  - The performance was in the middle region so I moved the Google Fonts link from the html document to the css document. I also changed the background image from jpg to webp.
